# Qiskit Architecture Follow-along Demo

This repository contains a follow-along demo which serves as a high-level overview of Qiskit's modules and capabilities.

## Overview
This demo walks through a complete quantum computing workflow using Qiskit, from building a parameterized quantum model to executing it on simulated backends. The notebook demonstrates key concepts including:

1. Physical Model Simulation: Building and simulating a 4-qubit Heisenberg Hamiltonian evolution
2. Quantum Circuit Design: Creating parameterized quantum circuits with time evolution operators
3. Circuit Transpilation: Optimizing circuits for different hardware backends
4. Backend Execution: Running circuits on fake backends and simulators
5. Visualization: Comprehensive visualization of circuits, quantum states, and hardware properties
